            <p>I am Laura Swofford, a freelance UX designer. I have a UX Design certificate from the University of Oregon and I specialize in content strategy and UX writing and enjoy solving user problems that involve creating clarity. </p>
 
             <p> My skills include Figma, Adobe, Miro, Trello, and more. I find joy in critical and analytical thinking while using words to solve problems. I have worn a lot of hats, like a paralegal doing research, analyzing data, and writing and editing with attorneys and managing multiple attorneys to stay track to meet deadlines; a photographer in the studio and on location creating design with different angles; a sports writer covering my local soccer team live in the press box with player interviews after games and leading the MLS writers group as head editor; a supervisor of adults with disabilities and their staff and writing learning programs and managing the implementation of those programs and data collection to ensure state funding. Every step along the way has given me transferable skills for the UX world.</p>

            <h4>Petal</h4>
            <p>Petal is a holistic life management app created from user research to high fidelity prototyping by my team. </p>

            <p>Life can be a lot and sometimes we forget to eat or update the tags on the car. We could all use a little help and there are a lot of apps out there designed to help manage your time, but most hide key features, like setting reminders, behind a paywall. Almost none incorporate motivational, skill building, and time management features in one.</p>

            <h4>Lavender Rights Project</h4>
            <p>The Lavender Rights project expressed frustration with the simplicity of their website’s homepage and overall branding. They noted recent organizational restructuring and a failure to both reach and reflect, through their current branding, the new constituent base. They also want to increase donor engagement.</p>
            <p>Our solution was to redesign the website to include clear calls to action, a refreshed style guide based on the client’s current logo and publication graphics, a bold color scheme, more visual representation of constituents and staff, highlight major donors, and improve overall breathability.</p>
